## Overview

Suppose we have collected measurements about bacterial abundances from
a number of samples, and those samples fall into one of several
groups. We want to know if there is a statistically significant
difference between the groups, that is, whether it looks like
the microbiome samples from the different groups look like they could
all have come from all come from the same distribution.

One good non-parametric family of tests for this problem is based on
the Friedman-Rafsky[^1] test. The idea is to compute distances between
the samples, create a graph based on those distances, and use the
number of edges between samples of the same type (the number of "pure
edges") as a test statistic. We can then compute a $p$-value by
comparing the observed test statistic to the distribution of the test
statistic under the permutation distribution. 

[^1]: Friedman, J.H. and Rafsky, L.C. "Multivariate generalizations of
the Wald-Wolfowitz and Smirnov two-sample tests." The Annals of
Statistics (1979):697-717.

From the description above, we see that we have some choices to
make. We need to define a distance between the samples and choose a
method for creating a graph from those distances. These choices are
responsible for most of the arguments to `graph_perm_test`, the
primary function in this package.

## Specifying a distance

The `distance` argument in `graph_perm_test` allows you to specify a
distance. This can be any distance implemented in `phyloseq`, and it
should be taken from the following list:
```{r}
library(phyloseq)
unlist(distanceMethodList)
```
You can see the help page on
[distances](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/distance.html) for more
information. The distance should be chosen carefully and should
reflect the type of differences between samples you are interested in.

## Specifying a type of graph

`graph_perm_test` allows you to specify one of four options for a type
of graph: a minimum spanning tree, a $k$-nearest neighbors graph, and
two types of thresholded graphs. These are passed to the `type`
argument.

- `type = "mst"` creates a
  [minimum spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree). The
  minimum spanning tree places edges between the samples so that all
  of the samples are connected and the sum of the distances between
  samples connected by an edge is minimized.
- `type = "knn"` creates a $k$-nearest neighbors graph. For each
  sample, we place an edge between it and its $k$ nearest
  neighbors. This of course requires you to specify $k$ with the
  argument `knn`. A small number, on the order of 1 to 3 is likely a
  good choice.
- `type = "threshold.distance"` creates a distance threshold graph,
  and requires you to specify `max.dist`. The graph will be created by
  placing an edge between any pair of points where the distance
  between them is less than `max.dist`.
- `type = "threshold.nedges"` creates a distance threshold graph, and
  requires you to specify `nedges`. The graph will be created by
  computing distances between every pair of samples, and placing an
  edge between the `nedges` pairs of samples with the smallest
  distances between them.
  
Note that the `knn` argument is only used with `type = "knn"`, the
  `max.dist` argument is only used if `type = "threshold.distance"`,
  and the `nedges` argument is only used if `type =
  "threshold.nedges"`. `type = "mst"` requires no additional
  arguments.

In some
[simulations](https://jfukuyama.github.io/software/graph_testing_poster.pdf)
we saw that the minimum spanning tree and k-nearest neighbors had the
most power. The minimum spanning tree is the simplest choice since it
doesnâ€™t require specifying any further parameters, but if you have
reason to believe that other types of graphs would be more appropriate
in your application they are also available. The $k$-nearest neighbors
graph might be desirable because it gives an interpretable test
statistic: the number of nearest neighbors that are of the same type.

## Running a test

Suppose that we have collected the data in the `enterotype` dataset,
which is available in the phyloseq package as a `phyloseq` object. We
can load the data and look at it with the following commands:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# not necessary, but I like the white background with ggplot
theme_set(theme_bw())
library(phyloseqGraphTest)
data(enterotype)
enterotype
```

Suppose we want to test for differences between sequencing platforms
(the `SeqTech` column in the sample data). We have also decided we
want to use the Jaccard dissimilarity and a $k$-nearest neighbors
graph with $k$ = 1 to perform our test. Then we would use the
following commands to run the test and view the output:
```{r}
gt = graph_perm_test(enterotype,
                     sampletype = "SeqTech",
                     distance = "jaccard",
                     type = "knn",
                     knn = 1)
gt
```
We see that the difference between sequencenig platforms is
statistically significant, with a $p$-value of .002. The effect is
also quite substantial: we see from the observed test statistic that
out of the 221 total edges in the 1-nearest neighbors graph, 197 of
them connect samples of the same type. 


## Detailed output from the test

The output from `graph_perm_test` is a `psgraphtest` object, which is
a list containing information about the test. The elements of the list
are:

- `observed`: The observed test statistic, the number of pure edges. 

- `perm`: A vector containing the value of the test statistic (the
  number of pure edges) in each of the permuted datasets.
  
- `pval`: The p-value for the permutation test. This is the fraction
  of times the number of pure edges in the permuted dataset exceeded
  the number of pure edges in the observed dataset.
  
- `net`: The graph used for testing.
  
- `sampletype`: A vector containing the group label for each sample.
	
- `type`: The type of graph used.

These can be inspected by hand, but the package also contains some
functions for plotting the results.


## Plotting the results of the test

The function `plot_test_network` plots the graph we created on the
samples, the sample identities, and the edge types (pure or mixed,
i.e. edges between samples of the same type or edges between samples
of different types). Here we see that the nearest neighbor graph
connects largely samples of the same type. 
```{r}
plot_test_network(gt)
```

The function `plot_permutations` will plot a histogram of the number
of pure edges in each of the permuted datasets along with the number
of pure edges in the observed dataset. For this dataset, we see that
the number of pure edges in the observed dataset is well outside of
the permutation distribution.
```{r}
plot_permutations(gt)
```


## Additional arguments

There are a couple of other arguments to the `graph_perm_test`
function. `nperm` is the number of permutations to use for the
test. The default is 499, and it can be increased or decreased
depending on how much computational time you have and how closely you
want to approximate the full permutation distribution.

You can also specify a stratifying variable using the `grouping`
argument. This is necessary in repeated measures designs. Suppose for
instance that we have mice in two different litters, and we would like
to test for equality of the distributions from the two litters. If we
have more than one sample taken from each of the mice, permuting the
litter label over all the samples independently will not give a valid
test because of the dependence between samples taken from the same
mouse. We can fix this by considering the mice the independent units
and permuting the litter label over mouse instead of over sample to
obtain a valid test.
